#Soa Cafe Front-End

Soa Cafe is a simple website mock-up for a cafe business. This website has several features:
1. Display the cafe's menu.
2. Order food or drinks on the menu.
3. View the user's personal data (does not include the process of logging in and editing data).
4. See some general information about Soa Cafe.

This website is built using React Hooks, HTML, and CSS. The data displayed on this website is still hard coded because this website does not have a back-end section, but the process for API calls to the back-end section has been made.

The following is the process that needs to be done to run the code in this repository:
1. Download the code.
2. Enter the "soa-cafe-front-end" directory.
3. Open a terminal.
4. Type "npm i" in the terminal, then press the "Enter" key.
5. Wait until the package installation is complete.
5. Type "npm start" in the terminal, then press the "Enter" key.
5. Wait until the Soa Cafe website opens in your browser.
